A lot has happened to us all since 1987. Thats the year The Art of the Deal
was published and became the bestselling business book of the decade,
with over three million copies in print.
(Business Rule #1: If you do not  tell people about your success, they
probably wont know about it.)
A few months ago, I picked up The Art of the Deal, skimmed a bit, and
then read the first and last paragraphs. I realized that after seventeen years
they still rang true. I could have written these words yesterday:
First paragraph: I do not do it for the money. I have got enough, much more
than I will ever need. I do it to do it. Deals are my art form. Other people paint
beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably
big deals. That is how I get my kicks.
Last paragraph: Do not get me wrong. I also plan to keep making deals, big
deals, and right around the clock.
It is now 2004, I am still making deals around the clock, and I still dont
do it for the money.
I do not think you should do it for the money, either. Money is not an
end in itself, but it is sometimes the most effective way to help us realize
our dreams. So if you have got big dreams and youâ€™re looking for a way to
make them happen, this book is for you.
